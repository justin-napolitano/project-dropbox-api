A Python-based utility to upload files to Dropbox using the official Dropbox API. This project provides a simple script to automate file backups to a specified Dropbox path.

---

## Features

- Upload local files to Dropbox with overwrite capability
- Basic error handling for Dropbox API errors, including insufficient space
- Easily configurable access token and file paths

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.5+
- Dropbox Python SDK

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 or higher installed
- Dropbox Python SDK installed

```bash
sudo pip install dropbox
```

- Dropbox app created at [Dropbox Developer Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) with an access token generated

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/project-dropbox-api.git
cd project-dropbox-api
```

### Configuration

- Insert your Dropbox API access token in the `dropbox_upload.py` script at the `TOKEN` variable
- Adjust `LOCALFILE` and `BACKUPPATH` variables as needed to specify the local file and Dropbox destination path

### Running

Run the upload script:

```bash
python dropbox_upload.py
```

## Project Structure

```

└── test.txt           # Sample file for upload
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Complete and expand file detail checking functions
- Add support for uploading multiple files or entire directories
- Implement token management and refresh logic
- Add unit and integration tests
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Provide command-line arguments for flexibility
- Support Python versions beyond 3.5
